            <p> I'm from the small state of Kansas, where I have returned from traveling the world of Oz after defeating the wicked witch of the waste. Now that I have returned to back to normal society, I have taken up coding by recommendation of my older brother. With my newfound coding skills, I hope to make a long lasting career and hope to return to Oz one day to make it an technologic empire.</p>

            <p>My name is Shawn, and I was born and raised in San Antonio. Throughout my life, I've held onto the belief that, "No matter how hard life pulls you down, you must keep your head above water, or you'll sink." I'm a firm believer in the power of positivity and the importance of always moving forward, even if the path isn't always clear-cut. Sometimes, it requires taking a zigzag route, but as long as you're making progress, you're headed in the right direction.That's precisely why I transitioned into my current career field, which has given me the chance to grow and continue moving forward. I'm excited to see where this new opportunity takes me and to learn from the challenges and experiences it offers.In conclusion, I'm grateful for the chance to pursue a career that aligns with my values and allows me to keep moving forward. I look forward to the challenges and growth that lie ahead, and I'm confident that with a positive attitude and a commitment to learning and adapting, I'll continue to thrive.
